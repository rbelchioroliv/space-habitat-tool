## 🪐 Singularity: Visual Tool for Space Habitat Design

Singularity is an interactive 3D web application designed to democratize the design of space habitats by transforming complex engineering parameters into intuitive and educational visual experiences. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js, the tool enables users to create and simulate habitable structures for orbital, lunar, and Martian environments, following constraints and best practices based on NASA’s Human Spaceflight Architecture standards.

## 🧭 Purpose and Vision

Designing habitats in space is one of the most complex challenges in interplanetary exploration. Current tools often require advanced technical knowledge, excluding students, educators, and the general public from meaningful participation in space innovation.

**Singularity** bridges this gap by providing a user-friendly, scientifically grounded platform to:

- Conceptualize space habitats in various environments (Moon, Mars, Orbit)

- Simulate internal layouts and modular configurations

- Validate design constraints using real mission parameters (crew size, duration, gravity, volume, radiation exposure)

- Inspire and educate future generations of space architects, engineers, and explorers


## 🧩 Key Features

🌐 Environment and Mission Parameters

- Select target environment: Lunar surface, Martian surface, or orbital station

- Configure mission parameters: crew size, duration, EVA frequency

- Choose habitat structure type: Metallic, Inflatable, or In-situ Manufactured

## 🧱 Habitat Modeling and Visualization

- Define base geometry: sphere, cylinder, toroid, etc.

- Real-time 3D visualization (exterior/interior views)

- Volume and floor area computation

- Launch compatibility validation (e.g., SLS Block 1B payload constraints)

## 🗂 Functional Zoning and Layout

- Internal partitioning into functional areas:

    - Sleep Quarters

    - Hygiene Facilities

    - Food Preparation & Cultivation

    - Medical Bay

    - Exercise Zones

    - Command & Control

    - Waste Management

- Intelligent zoning recommendations:

    - Noise isolation

    - Functional adjacency

    - Traffic flow analysis

## 📊 Validation and Metrics

- Automatic validation using NASA parameters:

    - Internal Pressurized Volume (IPV)

    - Net Habitable Volume (NHV)

    - Volume per crew member

    - Radiation shielding analysis

- Real-time feedback:

    - Green: meets NASA constraints

    - Red: violates mission parameters


## 💡 Educational Focus and Impact

### Target Audience:

- Students (high school, technical, university)

- Educators and curriculum designers

- Enthusiasts of space science and exploration

## Intended Outcomes:

- Promote inclusion in STEM disciplines

- Support project-based learning on sustainability and habitability
